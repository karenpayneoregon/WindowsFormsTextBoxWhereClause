# About
This code sample uses [Common.CheckComboBox](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Common.CheckComboBox/) NuGet package which provides a ComboBox with a dropdown list with checkboxes. Make selections, press enter and the Text property is populated with checked items.

The control is not perfect, this is but one example for performing SELECT WHERE IN where space may be limited. Usually a better option would be a CheckedListBox when space is available.
